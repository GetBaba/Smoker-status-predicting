# Smoker-status-predicting
Using a ML model to predict the smoker status of employees of a fictitious company

This is a project that I worked on with a few classmates, where we used a Kaggle dataset that we tested a few ML models with. We ended up choosing ..

The Kaggle dataset was quite comprehensive that had data points concerning for example: BMI; hemoglobin levels; hearing; eyesight; dental caries etc..

We first cleaned the data and performed a data engineering process in order to improve the performance of the models we were testing. With all these models, we also heavily experimented by testing out different hyperparameters and scalers for each case.
